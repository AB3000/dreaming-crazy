Storyline-based/multileveled game

Project Background:
[Why was this project chosen? How does it match your interests?]
	I chose to pursue a game because I always wanted to express my dreams (the ones I have at night when I sleep) and materialize my thoughts into words. I really love working with graphics, animation, storylines, and programming, but I have so much to learn, and I cannot wait to learn from Ria! Additionally, I have always been captivated by story-based games, and I always wanted to make one of my own. 

Project Description:
[What is the goal of the project? What technologies will be used? What will the final product look like?]
	Although I do not have too much experience in game design, I was interested in using Unity and Inkscape for my vector graphics and programming. I want to make a level-based and story-based game that has a mysterious/action/adventure/sci-fi (yes, a lot of genres) sound to it. The final game will be more of a scrolling-screen game in which each level has several rooms and objects that need to be collected and used in specific ways/areas in order for the player to solve puzzles to go to the next checkpoint or level.    
  
  
Goals: 
Learn the basics of C#, level-based/storyline-based game design, improve my vector drawing and animation skills.

Mentorship Plan:
[How often is the mentor/mentee pair going to meet? When/where?]
	Currently, we were thinking of meeting every Wednesday at 4:00 in the PMU. 

Timeline:
[Add at least four checkpoints besides the ones listed below.]
